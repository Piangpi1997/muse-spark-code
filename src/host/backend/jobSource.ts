// first built, instead of riding in the host bundle as strings (PLAN.md D6,
// the M55 and M56 size receipts). Each helper is its own file (its `using`
// directives first, then its types) followed by the Win32 half both share,
// MuseSparkMcpJob.cs. A missing or unreadable file fails that helper's
// preparation, which each helper already reports and falls back from.
